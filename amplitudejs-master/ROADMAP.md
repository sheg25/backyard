#Roadmap

Right now Amplitude.js is simple. It provides a wrapper for the
HTML5 Audio Element.  With the wrapper, we began to see the 
possibility of what Amplitude.js could be.  The vision for Amplitude.js
is much more powerful.

##Vision
The HTML 5 Audio ELement made it very easy to play audio through the
web on supported browsers without the use of Flash.  However the
next step is here with the Web Audio API.  Being fresh and cutting
edge, the support is just beginning. Amplitude.js will be there from
the beginning and start wrapping and creating features for a full
suite of tools to develop advanced audio playback applications.
In the release of Amplitude.js 2.0, we added support for audio 
visualizations.  Using the simplicity of Amplitude.js, users are able
to add live, generated visualizations for their players as simple
as adding an element with "amplitude-visualization" and registering
the visualization they want in a plugin style.  There are more
Web Audio API additions to come.

##Extended Elements
Below is a list of what we hope to be adding to Amplitude.js
* amplitude-cut-freq=X Uses the web audio api to cut frequencies
* amplitude-gain=X Uses the web audio api to gain frequencies
* amplitude-circular-status Fills an element circularly to the represent the status of a song

If there are any additional elements that you wish to have added, please adjust and open an issue.
