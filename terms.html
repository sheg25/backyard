<p>We offer multiple distinct services. Some of the terms below relate specifically to one service, and other terms relate generally to all services we offer. We may update the Terms from time to time without notice to you. Unless expressly stated otherwise, any new features that augment, enhance or otherwise modify the Platform shall be subject to these Terms. By accessing and using this Platform, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms and The Muse’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://www.themuse.com/user/terms and are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

You have the option to log in to your Muse Account via LinkedIn, or via email. You may never use another person’s Muse Account. When creating your Muse Account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Muse Account, and you must keep your Muse Account password secure. You must notify The Muse immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Muse Account. Although The Muse will not be liable for any losses or damages caused by any unauthorized use of your Muse Account, you may be liable for the losses of The Muse, Muse Coach Connect, or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
<h1>THE MUSE COACH CONNECT PLATFORM TERMS</h1>
<p>These Terms will apply specifically to usage of The Muse Coach Connect Platform.</p>
<h2>Coaching Sessions and Financial Terms for Clients</h2>
<p>The Coaches, and not Muse Coach Connect, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Coaching Sessions and completing any Coaching Sessions reserved through the Platform. If The Muse or selected Coach cancels a booked Coaching Session, any amounts collected by Muse Coach Connect for the corresponding Coaching Session will be refunded to such Client, as applicable. If Client cancels a booked Coaching Session, no amounts collected by Muse Coach Connect for the corresponding Coaching Session will be refunded to such Client.</p>
<p>If you choose to enter into any agreement with a Coach outside the Platform, Muse Coach Connect will not be a party to such agreement and disclaims all liability arising from or related to the same.</p>
<p>To establish a Coaching Session, Muse Coach Connect will collect the total price of the Coaching Session in accordance with the pricing terms on the Platform. Please note that Muse Coach Connect cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Client by his or her bank related to Muse Coach Connect’s collection of payment, and Muse Coach Connect disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>In connection with your requested Coaching Session, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Muse Coach Connect or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Muse Coach Connect for any Coaching Sessions made in connection with your Muse Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Platform. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the Coaching Session, either directly by Muse Coach Connect or indirectly, via a third party payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Platform. If you are directed to Muse Coach Connect’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your Coaching Session is purchased you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your Coaching Session.</p>
<h2>Copyright Ownership</h2>
<p>The Content, Platform, and Services are the property of The Muse, and are protected by all applicable copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You acknowledge and agree that the Content, Platform, and Services, including all associated intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of The Muse and its licensors. You will not edit, remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Content, Platform, or Services. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms, The Muse grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, to (i) access and view any Muse Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes and (ii) access and view any Coach Content to which you are permitted access, solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You have no right to sublicense the license rights granted in this section.</p>
<p>The Coach Content is the property of the applicable Coach and is protected by all applicable copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries.</p>
<p>You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise exploit the Content, Platform, and Services, except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise to any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by The Muse or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>
<h1>COMPANY RESEARCH, CONTENT, AND JOB APPLICATION TERMS</h1>
<p>These terms will apply specifically to usage of Company Research, Content, and Job Application Platform.</p>
<h2>Job Applications</h2>
<p>The Muse allows professionals to get an inside look at great companies, and apply to jobs. Users have the option to log in to our website via their Muse Account. We may additionally, but are not obligated to, allow users to save companies to a favorites list, save job openings to apply to later, and upload a resume/cover letter/other professional information in order to apply to jobs.</p>
<h2>Your Copyright</h2>
<p>Because our service permits user-uploaded content, we must ensure that all content uploaded to us may be used legally by us without having to remove it at a later date due to a revocation of license by the uploading user, or a copyright complaint by the rightful owner. Although we are protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for the alleged infringement by third-party users, complying with takedown requests still costs us time and money. Therefore, by uploading any content to our website, you agree that you grant us a universal, perpetual, sublicensable, commercial, and non-commercial, irrevocable license to use such content, and that you represent to us that you have the right to grant such a license. You agree to indemnify us as well as any third party affected by your wrongful representations if you should represent falsely that you have the right to grant this license.</p>
<h2>Our Copyright</h2>
<p>The Muse depends on user-submitted content, such as resumes, cover letters, job descriptions, and company descriptions—as well as our own content, such as research on companies and other information—in order to preserve its search rankings and be unique in general. Because of the nature of our service, it is imperative that we protect our content from being distributed elsewhere, no matter how well-intentioned such a distribution might be. Therefore, you agree not to copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on our website, or our website itself, without our prior written permission, regardless of whether it is created or owned by The Muse, or licensed to The Muse by some third party, such as another user. This includes a prohibition on copying any content which would otherwise be in the public domain, protected by the doctrine of fair use, or otherwise able to be legally copied, since if numerous users were to copy content from our website, it could negatively impact our network capacity. You may, of course, copy such things from other sources where otherwise legally permitted to do so.</p>

<li>• your name;</li>
<li>• the name of the party whose copyright has been infringed, if different from your name;</li>
<li>• the name and description of the work that is being infringed;</li>
<li>• the location on our website of the infringing copy;</li>

<li>
• a statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect to its use.<br>
You must sign this notification and send it to our Copyright Agent at:<br>
Attn: themuse.com Copyright Agent<br>
Daily Muse Inc.<br>
151 West 25th Street, 9th floor<br>
New York, New York 10001<br>
United States<br>
<a href="mailto:terms@themuse.com">terms@themuse.com</a><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If sending the notification by email, an electronic signature is acceptable.</p>
<p>Although no similar provisions exist under U.S. law for trademark infringement, we recommend that you submit similar information to us about any alleged trademark infringement so that we can take appropriate action.</p>
<h2>Communications Decency Act</h2>
<p>Although our Code of Conduct prohibit users from posting defamatory material, we cannot ensure that it does not occur due to our limited editorial resources. Under Section 230 of the <i>Communications Decency Act</i>, we are not liable for defamatory material published by third parties (such as our users) on our website.</p>
<p>We recommend that you report any alleged defamation by third parties to us with full details of who you are and how the material is defamatory and, if we agree it is defamatory, we may remove it. However, do not attempt to sue us, whether or not we remove such material, as we are not liable due to the <i>Communications Decency Act</i> and will attempt to recover any attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements from you that are incurred as a result of defending against such an unfounded lawsuit.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the <i>SPEECH Act 2010</i>, you cannot attempt to sue us in another country for defamation and then attempt to domesticate the judgment in the United States to enforce it.</p>
<p>If it is unclear to us whether something is defamatory or not, regardless of whether it is a legal or factual lack of clarity, we will likely not remove the complained-about content. However, we may remove it in such instances if you produce for us a court order or declaration from within the United States declaring the specific content complained about to be unlawful.</p>
<p>Note that any actions we take to police defamatory material on our website are strictly voluntary, and we reserve all rights under the <i>Communications Decency Act</i>, as well as any other statutory, constitutional, or common law defenses.</p>
<p>If you believe that Daily Muse Inc., rather than a third party, has posted defamatory material, please contact us with full details at <a href="mailto:terms@themuse.com">terms@themuse.com</a> so that we can mitigate any alleged loss as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Representations &amp; Warranties</h2>
<p>We make no representations or warranties as to the merchantability of our Content, Platform, or Services or fitness for any particular purpose. You agree that you are releasing us from any liability that we may otherwise have to you in relation to or arising from this Agreement or our products, for reasons including, but not limited to, failure of our service, loss of income, negligence, or any tort or other cause of action. To the extent that applicable law restricts this release of liability, you agree that we are only liable to you for the minimum amount of damages that the law restricts our liability to, if such a minimum exists.</p>
<p>You agree that we are not responsible in any way for offers made by third parties through our website.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any failure of our service, including any failures or disruptions, scheduled or unscheduled, intentional or unintentional, on our website which prevent access to our website temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that our website may become unavailable at any given time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice, and we will not be liable to you for any loss therefrom.</p>
<p>The provision of our service to you is contingent on your agreement with this and all other sections of this Agreement. Nothing in the provisions of this "Representations &amp; Warranties" section shall be construed to limit the generality of the first paragraph of this section.</p>
<h2>Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless The Muse and its principals, shareholders, agents, officers, directors, consultants, and employees from or against third-party claims, damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses arising from or relating to any third-party claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of the breach of The Muse’s representations and warranties contained herein.</p>
<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>We may link to third-party websites from our own website including, among other things, coach websites or third-party payment processors. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third-party websites or their use of your personal information. We recommend that you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website.</p>
<h2>Notices</h2>
<p>You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email (using the email address you provide to us either during the registration process or when you updated your email address) or by posting notices on this Platform. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. In addition to, but not in limitation of the foregoing, except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to us shall be given by email.</p>
<h2>Choice of Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of New York. The offer and acceptance of this contract is deemed to have occurred in the State of New York.</p>
<h2>Forum of Dispute</h2>
<p>You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York. Specifically, you agree that any disputes shall be heard, where eligible, solely within the Civil Court of the City of New York—Small Claims Part (“Small Claims Court”).</p>
<p>You agree that where the amount you would otherwise claim exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, which at the time of the publication of this Agreement is up to $5,000, you will waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead only sue us for the maximum amount of $5,000.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have multiple causes of action, you agree that if your claim would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, except that one or more of the causes of action or other rights to collect damages would not be eligible for the Small Claims Court to hear, you will waive your right to claim damages for any of the ineligible claims and instead still bring the dispute in the Small Claims Court for only the claim or claims over which the Small Claims Court has jurisdiction to hear.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you would otherwise have any non-monetary remedies available to you outside of the Small Claims Court, such as the right to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, you agree that you will waive your right to obtain such relief against us. If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.</p>
<p>You agree that the prevailing party in any dispute will be entitled to claim from the unsuccessful party the entire amount of the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements in relation to the dispute.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by The Muse without restriction.</p>
<p>This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by Coach or any other party without the prior written consent of The Muse, and such consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason.</p>
<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<p>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, and any other legal notices published by The Muse on the Platform, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and The Muse concerning the Platform, your use of the Services and any Content. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any one provision set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and The Muse’s failure to assert or enforce any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<h2>Amendments</h2>
<p>We may amend these Terms from time to time, and the amended version will be posted on our website in place of the old version and it is your responsibility to check these terms for any amendments. We will also include the date that the currently displayed Terms took effect to help you determine whether there have been any changes since you last used our website. Like our Privacy Policy, you must visit this page each time you come to our website and read and agree to it if the date it was last modified is more recent than the last time you agreed to the Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must immediately cease using our Content, Platform, and Services.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Any inquiries about your rights under these Terms, or any other matters regarding your privacy, can be directed to <a href="mailto:terms@themuse.com">terms@themuse.com</a>.</p>

<li>To connect you with any coach you have hired or agreed to work with through Coach Connect.</li>

<h2>Cookies &amp; Remarketing</h2>
<p>We use cookies to save your preferences. For this reason, it is necessary that you have cookies enabled in order to get the most out of our service.</p>
<p>We also may use third-party vendor remarketing tracking cookies. This means we would continue to show ads to you across the Internet. The third-party vendors, including Google, whose services we use, will place cookies on web browsers in order to serve ads based on past visits to our website. Third-party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. This allows us to make special offers and continue to market our services to those who have shown interest in our services.</p>
<h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>We may link to third party websites from our own website including, among other things, company websites. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party websites or their use of your personal information. We recommend that you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website.</p>
<h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>
<p>We protect your information from being accessed by third parties. However, since we may employ outside maintenance personnel or use a third party to host our material, there are third party entities which may have custody or access to your information. Moreover, if you hire or agree to work with a coach on Coach Connect, we will give that coach your information to allow us and them to give you the best service possible. Because of this, it is necessary that you permit us to give access to your information to third parties to the same extent that you authorize us to do so. For greater certainty, every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to share information with LinkedIn and any companies to which you apply for a job using The Muse service or with a coach on Coach Connect when you hire or agree to work with such coach.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.</p>
<h2>Security of Information</h2>
<p>We take steps to protect our systems, as it is in our interests to secure our systems against external threats. However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.</p>
<h2>Amendments</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and the amended version will be posted on our website in place of the old version. We will also include the date that the currently displayed Privacy Policy took effect to help you determine whether there have been any changes since you last used our website. Like our Terms of Use, you must visit this page each time you come to our website and read and agree to it if the date it was last modified is more recent than the last time you agreed to the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using our website and services.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Any inquiries about your rights under this Privacy Policy, or any other matters regarding your privacy, can be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy@themuse.com">privacy@themuse.com</a>.</p>
