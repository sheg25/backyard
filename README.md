CHALLENGES:

This website is being built by using https://www.themuse.com/ as a template because the similarities in their focus. However, the homepage is built on a bootstrap template called Backyard. The challenges being faced on this project are:

1. understanding what the different javascript/jquery code used on the template site does and which one can be used on YouEnrol.me
2. where there's a need to use a code that was not part of the template, how to integrate the new code into the template to achieve the desired result
3. There's a lot of work required! 
4. MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE TO ALL FELLOW CODER COLLABORATORS ON THIS PROJECT. I OWE YOU ONE ;)
